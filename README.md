## Why is Ms Doubtfire coming over?
For baby's first year
+ Average bowel movement per day - 10
+ Average number of diaper changes per month - 260
+ Average number of feeds per day - 6


+ **Minimum number of tasks or events a parent has to track per day - 24**
+ **Approx number of tasks or events a parent has to track per year - 8760**
+ **Approx time consumed if each task takes a minute - 146 hrs or 6 days**



And when a child is crying in hunger, lack of sleep or has soiled the diaper, last thing a parent can think of is to find that Baby Care Worksheet, search for the clock, make a note.

For some, they manage, but for most there are half filled worksheets. The continious nature of these events, makes it hard for parents to find a pattern, for their child & themselves.

## So what will Ms Doubtfire do?
+ Helps you track those little, but important things, without taking your presence away from the baby
+ Helps parents, find sense of personal well being through empathy & advice
+ Aids in managing tasks & communicating them with spouses or co-parents

## How will Ms Doubtfire do it?
+ Being present across multiple assistance platforms, at home & outside
+ Learning about your patterns relevant to your child's care & yourself as a parent. And using that to predict & advice
+ Being there with you, at 2 am in the night, as you try to rock your little baby to sleep
